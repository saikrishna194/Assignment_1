1.In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
A)
* -----expression

'hello'-----values

-87.8 ----- values

- -----expression

/ -----expression

+ -----expression

6 -----values.

2.What is the difference between string and variable?

variables are container to store data 

eg:x=10

string is the sequene of characters that can be written in quotes

eg:'shankar'.

3.Describe three different data types.

integer:integer is uesd to store only numeric values

eg:2,3

float:float can store only floating values 

eg:2.334,6.56 

List: list is used for storing multiple data items in single variable.


4.What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
 
 expressions is combination of values ,variables,operators,and call  to functions an expression need to be evaluated if you ask python to print an expression,the interpreter evaluates the expression and dispay the results
 
 eg a=2+3.
 
 5.This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an

8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

the variable name cannot begin with a number if we should begin with, a string  like alphabet name then integer.

9.What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

str(),float(),int().


10.Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'i have eaten'+99+'burritos.'

because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings,if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.
